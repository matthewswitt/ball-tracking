# ball-tracking

Developed software that utilizes computer vision and OpenCV in Python to track different colour balls. The program asks the user to specify what colour ball they would like traced and then will track that colour. Developed an understanding of HSV and using HSV detectors, created ranges for each specific colour so different shades of that colour will be detected.

An example of the software tracking same colour but different shades:
